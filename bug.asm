mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + ecx * 4.  However, if ecx is a very large number, or if ebx points to an invalid memory location, this can lead to a segmentation fault or other memory access violation.  This is particularly problematic if ecx is not properly validated before this instruction is executed.

Another example:

push ebp
mov ebp, esp
sub esp, 100h ; Allocate 256 bytes on the stack
; ... some code that might fail to restore esp ...
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp

This code allocates stack space but if the code between sub esp and mov esp, ebp throws an exception or returns prematurely, the stack pointer (esp) will not be properly restored and the next function call will corrupt the stack leading to unpredictable behavior and crashes.
